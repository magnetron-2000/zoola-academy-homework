Task 1: Solving conflicts

Use the same remote github repo from previous task. The task is to create conflicts. 3 times.

    First time – accept local changes instead of remote.
    Creat new branch confict-br
    Add new file conffile.txt
    and commit it to github
    then change it in github
    and in local machine
    make pull from github
    and solve conflict
